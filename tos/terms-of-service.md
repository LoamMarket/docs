**1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS**

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you") and Loam Market, Inc. ("**Company**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**"), concerning your access to and use of https://loam.market website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the "Site"). We are registered in California, United States. You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Site so that you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.

The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Site is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site. You may not use the Site in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years of age. All users must be legal adults in the jurisdiction in which they reside to participate in real-money predictions and transactions.

**2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

Unless otherwise indicated, the Site is our proprietary property and all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics on the Site (collectively, the "Content") and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the "Marks") are owned or controlled by us or licensed to us, and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws of the United States, international copyright laws, and international conventions. The Content and the Marks are provided on the Site "AS IS" for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no part of the Site and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without our express prior written permission.

Provided that you are eligible to use the Site, you are granted a limited license to access and use the Site and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Site, the Content and the Marks.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof).

**4. USER REGISTRATION**

You are required to register with the Site to participate in prediction markets. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. You must provide accurate identification and payment information to participate in real-money transactions.

**5. NATURE OF THE PLATFORM**

**5.1 Professional Assessment Platform**

Loam operates a professional job placement platform that uses prediction markets to evaluate candidates and match them with employers. **This is not a gambling platform.** The platform is designed for:

- Informed professional assessment of candidate skills and fit
- Data-driven matching between candidates and employers
- Rewarding expertise and accurate professional judgment
- Facilitating successful employment placements

**5.2 Prohibition on Gambling Behavior**

**Users are strictly prohibited from engaging in gambling-like behavior, including:**

- Making random or uninformed predictions without genuine assessment
- Consistently making predictions that prove to be inaccurate, demonstrating lack of professional judgment
- Attempting to manipulate markets for personal gain rather than accurate assessment
- Engaging in patterns of behavior that resemble gambling rather than informed professional evaluation

**We actively monitor prediction patterns and accuracy. Users found to be consistently wrong, guessing, or engaging in gambling-like behavior will be warned and may be permanently banned from the platform. This is essential to maintaining the integrity and professional nature of our marketplace.**

**5.3 Real Money Rewards**

Unlike play-money platforms, Loam uses real money to reward accurate predictions and successful placements. Participants who demonstrate expertise in evaluating candidates and matching them with employers earn real money based on their accuracy. This financial incentive is designed to encourage serious, informed participation and reward genuine professional insight.

**6. FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND PAYMENTS**

We accept the following forms of payment:

● Visa
● Mastercard
● Discover
● American Express
● Bank Transfer (ACH)

You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all transactions made via the Site. You further agree to promptly update account and payment information, including email address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed. All payments shall be in U.S. dollars.

**6.1 Real Money Transactions**

1. **Real Currency.** The Site uses real money for predictions, rewards, and payments. All transactions involve actual financial value and risk.

2. **Deposits and Withdrawals.** Users may deposit funds to participate in prediction markets and withdraw earnings according to our withdrawal policies. Minimum deposit and withdrawal amounts may apply.

3. **Earnings and Rewards.** Users earn real money based on the accuracy of their predictions and successful job placements. Earnings are subject to verification and may be adjusted for market manipulation or fraud.

4. **Fees.** We may charge transaction fees, platform fees, or service fees as disclosed at the time of transaction.

5. **Tax Reporting.** Earnings may be subject to tax reporting requirements. Users are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable taxes on earnings. We will issue tax forms as required by law (e.g., Form 1099 for U.S. users).

6. **Financial Regulations.** The Site operates in compliance with applicable financial regulations. We are not a gambling platform and are not subject to gambling regulations. Our platform facilitates professional assessment and job placement, not games of chance.

7. **Risk Disclosure.** Participation in prediction markets involves financial risk. You may lose money you deposit. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Participate only with funds you can afford to lose.

**7. REFUNDS POLICY**

Deposits are generally non-refundable once placed into predictions. Withdrawals of unallocated funds may be processed according to our withdrawal policy. Earnings are subject to verification before withdrawal.

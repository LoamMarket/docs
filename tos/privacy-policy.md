# Loam Market Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 1st, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Loam Market, Inc ("**Loam**" or "**we**", "**our**", or "**us**") operates a professional job placement platform that uses **play-money prediction markets** to gather information about candidates and match them with employers. We may provide discretionary real-money rewards for successful placements or accurate assessments. Because we handle sensitive employment information and may process reward payments, protecting your privacy is essential to our mission. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, the choices you have, and the rights you can exercise.

By using Loam—whether through our website, mobile apps, or any other services we provide (collectively, the "**Services**")—you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

HELLO WOLRD

I know sql and am very normal sane person. I also know how to read aws documentation and when I see an issue I don't guess what the problem is and hope it goes away on its own I go and dig to understand the world I live in and from that identify the most effective way to solve the problem without anyone having to yell at me.
